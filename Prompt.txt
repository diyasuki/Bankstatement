OUTPUT RULES (STRICT — DO NOT VIOLATE)

1. Return ONLY valid RFC8259-compliant JSON.
2. Do NOT include markdown, explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.
3. If a field is not present on the page, use null.
4. Normalize all dates to YYYY-MM-DD.
5. Normalize all currency values to decimals only (no commas, no currency symbols).
6. Debit amounts MUST be NEGATIVE.
7. Credit amounts MUST be POSITIVE.
8. Preserve transaction order EXACTLY as it appears across pages.
9. Do NOT infer, hallucinate, or fabricate transactions.
10. Remove duplicate transactions ONLY if date + amount + description are identical.
11. Ensure:
    opening_balance + sum(transactions.amount) = closing_balance
    If mismatch, set "balance_mismatch": true.



CHEQUE IMAGE EXCLUSION RULES (CRITICAL — MUST FOLLOW)

• DO NOT extract any values from cheque images.
• DO NOT read or use:
  - cheque images
  - scanned cheque photos
  - cheque front/back thumbnails
  - cheque deposit images
  - check images shown alongside transactions
• IGNORE ALL text inside cheque images, including:
  - cheque number
  - cheque amount
  - cheque date
  - payer / payee name
  - bank routing or MICR line

IMPORTANT:
✔ ONLY extract cheque-related transactions if they appear
  as NORMAL ROWS in the STATEMENT TRANSACTION TABLE.
❌ NEVER extract values directly from cheque images themselves.

If a page contains ONLY cheque images and NO transaction table rows:
→ Return:
{
  "transactions": []
}



MULTI-PAGE & COLUMN HEADER HANDLING (CRITICAL)

You are processing ONE PAGE AT A TIME, but the document is ONE CONTINUOUS BANK STATEMENT.

Column headers may:
- Appear only on the first page
- Appear partially on continuation pages
- Be completely absent on later pages

STRICT RULES:
1. When column headers are visible on ANY page, memorize them.
2. Apply the SAME column meaning to ALL subsequent pages.
3. If headers are missing on the current page:
   - Infer columns using alignment, spacing, repeated numeric patterns,
     and previously detected headers.
4. NEVER reinterpret column meaning across pages.
5. NEVER swap debit/credit logic between pages.
6. Treat all pages as part of a single continuous statement.



TOP-LEVEL OUTPUT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

You MUST ALWAYS return a JSON OBJECT.
NEVER return a bare JSON array.

If the page contains ONLY transactions, return them wrapped like this:
{
  "transactions": [ ... ]
}

NEVER return:
[
  { ... },
  { ... }
]



REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (FINAL)

{
  "bank_name": "",
  "account_holder_name": "",
  "account_number": "",
  "statement_period": {
    "from": "",
    "to": ""
  },
  "currency": "",
  "opening_balance": 0.00,
  "closing_balance": 0.00,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "date": "",
      "description": "",
      "amount": 0.00,
      "balance": 0.00,
      "type": "DEBIT | CREDIT",
      "category": "ATM | POS | TRANSFER | CHEQUE | FEE | INTEREST | SALARY | OTHER"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_debits": 0.00,
    "total_credits": 0.00,
    "transaction_count": 0
  },
  "flags": {
    "balance_mismatch": false,
    "missing_dates": false,
    "ocr_uncertain": false
  }
}



PAGE-LEVEL CONTINUATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

- Each page is part of the SAME bank statement.
- Do NOT reset running balances or transaction sequencing.
- Continuation pages may omit:
  - Account details
  - Opening balance
  - Column headers
- If header-level fields are not visible on the page, return null.
- Do NOT repeat header fields unless explicitly visible on the page.
- Maintain global transaction order across all pages.



TRANSACTION CLASSIFICATION RULES

• ATM → contains ATM or CASH
• POS → card / merchant / POS
• TRANSFER → NEFT / IMPS / ACH / WIRE / UPI
• CHEQUE → appears as a NORMAL ROW in the STATEMENT TABLE
• FEE → charges / fee / penalty
• INTEREST → interest
• SALARY → salary / payroll
• OTHER → anything else



OCR UNCERTAINTY HANDLING

Set "ocr_uncertain": true if:
- Amount digits are unclear
- Dates are partially unreadable
- Column alignment is ambiguous

Do NOT guess. Extract the best visible value only.



ASYNC / PER-PAGE PROCESSING NOTE (IMPORTANT)

- This page may be a continuation of previous pages.
- Use previously detected column headers and rules if not visible here.
- Maintain consistent column meaning and transaction order across pages.
